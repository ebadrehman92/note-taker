# NOTE-TAKER

# Description 
Create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

# Details
I'm presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note's text in the right hand column.

When a title note is entered a save icon appears in the navigation at the tope of the page.

When I click on the save icon then the new note is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the existing note.

When I click on an existing note in the list it appears in the right hand column.

When I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page. Then I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the noteâ€™s text in the right-hand column.
